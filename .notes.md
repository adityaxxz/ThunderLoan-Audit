Liquidty providers: someone who deposits money into the protocol to earn interest

- wheres the interest coming from?
    - in Tswap : fees from swapping
    - in thunderloan : fees from flashloan

ThunderLoan :

Token -> deposit -> assetToken

# Audits Notes : 

1. [](src/protocol/ThunderLoan.sol#L279)
s_flashLoanFee is a storage variable , when we are updating storage gotta emit an event.

2. [OracleUpgradeable.sol]
updrageable contracts cant have constructors
coz  , storage is in -> proxy
       logic is in -> implementation -> constructor

user (calls) -> proxy -> implementation 

3. Liquidity providers can deposit assets into `ThunderLoan` and be given `Asset Tokens` in return. These Asset Tokens *gain interest* over time depending on how often people take out flash loans.
